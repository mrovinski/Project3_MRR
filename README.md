This *notebook* contains my solution for **Programming Project 3**.
- Problem A: Write a function that will accept the filename of data about African country population for 5 years and return the dataset as a list.
- Problem B: Write a function that will accept a dataset that contains the African country populations that will return a NumPy array with only the numerical data.
- Problem C: Write a function that will accept a data list that contains the African country populations that will return PrettyTable of the data.
- Problem D: Write a function that will accept the NumPy array taht contains the population data for the African countries and that prints a summary table of statistics for each year.
- Problem E: Write a code that calls the functions to get the data from a file and extracts the data into an array and prints it into a data table and summary table.
